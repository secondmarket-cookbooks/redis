Description
===========

Installs [Redis](http://redis.io/), an advanced key-value store whose keys can be strings, hashes, lists, sets and sorted sets.

Requirements
============

## Platforms

* CentOS 5.x, 6.x
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.x, 6.x
* Ubuntu 12.04.1 (Precise)

Tested with Redis 2.4.x on CentOS/Red Hat Enterpise, and Redis 2.2.x on Ubuntu

## Cookbooks

* yum

Redis lives within the EPEL repository, so you'll need to include yum::epel in your run list. (It seems to be a matter of debate whether or not cookbook authors should `include_recipe` this -- I haven't, at least for now.)

Attributes
==========

Global options
--------------

* `['redis']['server']['bind_address']` - what address to bind to (default 127.0.0.1; set to 0.0.0.0 if you're connecting to Redis from another server)
* `['redis']['server']['idle_timeout']` - idle timeout
* `['redis']['server']['log_level']` - what log level should the Redis server log at
* `['redis']['server']['datadir']` - where RDB or AOF format snapshots/data files will live

RDB format snapshots
--------------------

* `['redis']['server']['snapshotting']` - whether to generate RDB format snapshots; false by default
* `['redis']['server']['snapshot_compression']` - whether to compress RDB format snapshots; true by default
* `['redis']['server']['snapshot_file']` - name of the snapshot file, 'dump.rdb' by default
* `['redis']['server']['snapshot_intervals']` - an array of snapshot policies, each element of which is a policy. Will save the DB if both the given number of seconds (the first element) and the given number of write operations (the second element) against the DB occurred.

Master-Slave
------------

Note that the slave finds the master using Search, so this doesn't work in Chef Solo.

* `['redis']['server']['is_slave']` - whether to operate this instance as a slave.
* `['redis']['server']['master_role']` - name of the role to search for, to find the master.

AOF (Append-Only File) Format Snapshots
---------------------------------------

* `['redis']['server']['appendonly']` - whether to generate AOF-format snapshots; default is false.
* `['redis']['server']['aof_file']` - name of the AOF file, 'appendonly.aof' by default
* `['redis']['server']['fsync_style']` - when to fsync() the file; 'everysec' by default

Recipes
=======

default
-------

Does nothing.

server
------

Installs Redis from EPEL packages and optionally configures it as a slave if you have set the `['redis']['server']['is_slave']` attribute.

Limitations
===========

* Not every parameter is configurable in redis.conf.
* Slave search logic assumes that you're using Chef environments and that the master resides in the same environment.
